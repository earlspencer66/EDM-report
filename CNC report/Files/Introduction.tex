\section{CNC Machining}
Numerical Control (NC) uses a processing language to control the movement of the cutting tool or workpiece or both. The programs contain information about the machine tool and cutting-tool geometry, the part dimensions (from rough to finish size), and the machining parameters (speeds and feeds and depth of cut). Onboard microprocessor which can be directly controlled gives rise to Computer Numerial Control (CNC) Machines.\\
Controlling CNC machines using variable inputs via a computer program is known as numerical control. The system automatically interprets some parts of the program in order to plot the tool control to create the desired part according to the NC program.
\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To design a program to create a part using CNC Machining.
	\item To program the CNC Machine tool.
	\item To create and examine a part made from the CNC Machining process.
\end{enumerate}
